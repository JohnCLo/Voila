Can you beat the market? A personal project that explores different trading strategies. You'll need to update the Quandl API key and run node server.js to collect your own stock data. Some strategies take longer to calculate than others, backtest_revised4.js (sloppy naming convention sorry!) utilizes an interesting moving double linked list queue computation strategy to reduce calculation intensity.
